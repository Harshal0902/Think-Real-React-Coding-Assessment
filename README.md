# Think Real React Coding Assessment

## ðŸ’¡ Task

My goal was to implement a simple React application, where users will be able to make & view an API request and responses.

### How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?

I used React with TailwindCSS as I am comfortable with it. I used Axios to make the API calls.

### Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

I can improve the UI for the webpage. I can also add more features to the application such as a debugging tool.

### What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

I can add more features to the application such as a debugging tool and imporve the UI.
